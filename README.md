## Mini Data Analysis Project (Part 1 & 2)

#### **Repository goals:**

This repository contains one mini data analysis (Mini data analysis 1 and Mini data analysis 2) completed for the course STAT545A at UBC. The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with data wrangling and visualization. This is done by using r code and packages such as dplyr, ggplot2 and tidyverse to produce information and graphs from a data set which is chosen from the package datateachr().

In part two of the mini data analysis, I answer four questions formulated by exploring the data in part one of the data analysis. For each of the four questions from milestone 1, I choose one summarizing activity and one graphing activity to further explore the question (and hopefully get closer to answering it!). Then I examine the data set and determine whether it is tidy or not - and proceed to untidy or tidy it dependent on its original state. The data analysis then goes on to explore modeling, where I use the lm() function to create a model then interpret it. Finally, I explore creating .csv and .rds files and creating a path using the here() function.
