## Mini Data Analysis Project (Part 1 & 2)

### **Repository goals:**

This repository contains one mini data analysis (Mini data analysis 1 and Mini data analysis 2) completed for the course STAT545A at UBC. The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with data wrangling and visualization. This is done by using R code and packages such as dplyr, ggplot2 and tidyverse to produce summary tables and graphs from a data set which is chosen from the package datateachr(). This activity is also done to build skills in fitting models using R and a data set. 

### **Mini Data Analysis – Part 1** 
[click here for detailed instructions](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/) 

In part one of the mini data analysis, I chose 4 data sets of interest from the package datateachr(). I then exlored these 4 data sets using dplyr functions until I decided which one I would like to continue exploring with for data analysis. The chosen data set was explored using 4 of 8 possible choices, with explanation for each choice. Knowing more about the data set I formulated four questions to be answered (or attempted to be answered) in milestone 2. 

### **Mini Data Analysis – Part 2**

In part two of the mini data analysis, I answer four questions formulated by exploring the data in part one of the data analysis. For each of the four questions from milestone 1, I choose one summarizing activity and one graphing activity to further explore the question (and hopefully get closer to answering it!). Then I examine the data set and determine whether it is tidy or not - and proceed to untidy or tidy it dependent on its original state. The data analysis then goes on to explore modeling, where I use the lm() function to create a model then interpret it. Finally, I explore creating .csv and .rds files and creating a path using the here() function.

1.	**README.md File**:
The README.md file consists of a brief overview of the goals of this repository/ project, an explanation of all the files/ folders in the repository. It also contains instructions on how to interact with this repository.

2.	**Milestone_1 Folder**:
 The Milestone_1 folder contains a brief **1.** *README.md* folder describing its contents. **2.** *Mini-project-1.Rmd* file which contains all R code for the **3.** *mini-project-1.md* file (also found in this folder) where you can see a final copy of milestone 1 for the mini data analysis.You will find anything pertaining to milestone 1 in the milestone 1 folder, this includes the **4.** *mini-project-1 files*. 
 
3.	**Milestone_2 Folder**:
The Milestone_2 folder contains a **1.** *README.md* file with a very brief description of the folder contents and project. **2.** *Mini-project-2.Rmd* file which contains the R code for the **3.** *mini-project-2.md* file, this is the file where you can view the final markdown document of milestone 2. Any other documents pertaining to Milestone 2 will be found in the milestone 2 folder such as the **4.**files folder. 
4.	**Output Folder**:
 The output folder contains a **1.** *README.md* file with a brief description of the folder contents.**2.** The *model_cherry.rds* file, which is a result of milestone 2 (*part 4.2*). **3.** You will find a *cher_dat.csv* which is also a result of milestone 2 (*part 4.1*). Each of the documents found in the output folder can be reproduced by knitting the the .md document found in milestone 1.
